# Insider Threat Detection

This project aims to develop a system for detecting potential insider threats within an organization by analyzing user activity logs. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the system seeks to identify unusual patterns that could indicate malicious or unauthorized actions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```bash
# Example of required tools and libraries (this will vary based on actual project requirements)
python>=3.7
numpy
pandas
sklearn
matplotlib
```
## Installing
**A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:**

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atulvinod01/InsiderThreatDetection.git
   cd InsiderThreatDetection
   ```
2. Install the required packages
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
  ```bash
   # Example Python code demonstrating a simple use case
    from insider_threat_detector import ThreatDetector
    
    detector = ThreatDetector()
    alerts = detector.analyze_log('path_to_log_file.csv')
    print(alerts)
  ```
